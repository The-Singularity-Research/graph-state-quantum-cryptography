## Graph States

Graph states are a special kind of quantum state prepared by a quantum circuit that is based on a graph, with nodes connected by vertices, as seen below:

Here is an example of a graph state quantum circuit:

## Graph State Quantum Cryptography

Using graph states, a protocol for transmitting quantum computations via the cloud to a potentially unsafe server for computation on remote quantum hardware can be developed using *blind quantum computing*. Check out the notebook for details.
